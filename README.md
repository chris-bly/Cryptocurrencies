# Cryptocurrencies
## Objective
The objective of this challenge was to develop a report that evaluates and categorizes cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market, and how best to categorize them for potential investment. The selected method for categorizing all the available cryptocurrencies will be to cluster them into general groupings and then visualize the findings.

## Deliverables
#### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- For this deliverable, we preprocessed the raw dataset in preparation of performing principal component analysis (PCA).
#### Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- In this deliverable, we leveraged a PCA algorithm to reduce the complexity of the model for further analysis.
#### Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Using a K-means algorithm, we developed an elbow curve to determine the optimal number of K-clusters for the crypto data which we will then group the different currencies into.
#### Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
- Finally, we visualized the grouped cryptocurrencies based on the PCA elements using Plotly Express and the ```hvplot``` data visualization tool.

## Conclusions
After preprocessing the data, it was clear that the 533 different cryptocurrencies that were available on the market could be best grouped into 4 distinct clusters. Further analysis can be done to investigate the difference between clusters to see if a particular category is optimal for investment, or if a diversified wallet will lead to the most secure investment.
